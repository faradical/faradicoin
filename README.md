## Abstract
Faradicoin is a project developed to explore and demonstrate the underlying technology of crypotocurrencies. It is constructed on a Proof-of-Work based Blockchain similiar to what is used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The project is currently written in JavaScript using the MERN stack with the elliptic module handling encryption keys and crypto-js/sha256 to perform cryptographic hashing. It demonstrates all the basics of a modern cryptocurrency including the technical aspects and core principles required in creating a viable currency using a decentralized, trustless network.

## Objective
--->

## Transaction Verification
Transactions in Faradicoin are constructed at the wallet level and submitted to miners in JSON format. Each transaction features five default properties: a sender address, reciever address, transaction amount, time stamp, and the hash of the last transaction created by the sender wallet.

## Proof-of-Work


## Block Verification
<!---
A key element in all distributed blockchains is decentralized censensus. Network rules

## Incentive vs. Trust
Why follow the rules?

## Further Developments
* Mining fees
* Alternative proof systems
* Smart Contracts
* Storing data directly on the blockchain.
* Merkle Trees
* Adaptive difficulty and block rewards.
