## Abstract
Faradicoin is a project developed to explore and demonstrate the underlying technology of crypotocurrencies. It is constructed on a Proof-of-Work based Blockchain similiar to what is used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The project is currently written in JavaScript using the MERN stack with the elliptic module handling encryption keys and crypto-js/sha256 to perform cryptographic hashing. It demonstrates all the basics of a modern cryptocurrency including the technical aspects and core principles required in creating a viable currency using a decentralized, trustless network.

## Objective


## Transaction Verification
Still need to add previous transaction hash to the hash of the current transaction to ensure duplicate transactions sent at the same time do not also feature the same hash.
