## Abstract
Faradicoin is a project developed to explore and demonstrate the underlying technology of crypotocurrencies. It is constructed on a Proof-of-Work based Blockchain similiar to what is used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The project is currently written in JavaScript using the MERN stack with the elliptic module handling encryption keys and crypto-js/sha256 to perform cryptographic hashing. It demonstrates all the basics of a modern cryptocurrency including the technical aspects and core principles required in creating a viable currency using a decentralized, trustless network.

## Objective


## Transaction Verification
Still need to add previous transaction hash to the hash of the current transaction to ensure duplicate transactions sent at the same time do not also feature the same hash.
![Faradicoin_Transaction_Signing](Documentation/Faradicoin_Transaction_Signing.png)

* Hashing + Signing mining rewards (Use previous blocks reward hash?)
* Previous hash for normal transactions will be the hash of the last transaction sent OR received by the current transactions sender.

## Proof-of-Work


## Block Verification
A key element in all distributed blockchains is decentralized censensus. Network rules

## Incentive vs. Trust
Why follow the rules?

## Further Developments
* Mining fees
* Alternative proof systems
* Smart Contracts
* Storing data directly on the blockchain.
* Merkle Trees

## Conclusion
